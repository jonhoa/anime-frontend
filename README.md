AnimeWatch is a full-stack app created in Ruby on Rails and ReactJs. This captivating platform utilizes the KITSU API, an unofficial MAL API, to dynamically showcase a vast collection of anime titles in a user-friendly way.

<li>Extensive Anime Catalog: Explore a wide array of anime titles, from beloved classics to the latest releases, all conveniently organized for seamless browsing.</li>

<li>User-Friendly Interface: Enjoy a visually appealing and intuitive interface that makes navigating and discovering anime a delightful experience.</li>

<li>Favorites and Recommendations: Solve media-consuming indecisiveness by "favoriting" the titles that catch your interest. AnimeWatch provides personalized recommendations based on your preferences, making it easier than ever to find your next favorite anime.</li>

<li>Detailed Information: Each anime title comes with a comprehensive description and an embedded YouTube trailer, allowing you to get a taste of the storyline, animation style, and overall vibe before adding it to your favorites.</li>
